          Greetings!
          
          <br /><br />
          Hope this email finds you well. I am Kashif Ahmad, writing to you on
          behalf of the Sir Syed Global Scholar Award (SSGSA) Applications
          Team. We thank you for being associated with the SSGSA for the past
          few years. 

          <br /><br />
          We are currently accepting applications, and expect to send those out
          for review by February 24, 2023. <b>If you are willing to serve as a
          reviewer for this session, please accept the invitation through the
          link provided below.</b>

          <br /><br />
          You would have around 15 days to review approximately 15 applications
          (at most). In order to assist you through the review process, SSGSA
          Applications Team will also be organizing an orientation session on
          Feb 18, 2023. You attendance is highly encouraged so that we can
          ensure consistency in the reviews. We will send out the details once
          you accept that invitation.
          
          <br /><br />
          Should you have any questions about the review process. You can
          either write to me at kkashif@alumni.purdue.edu or the Chair at
          chair@ssgsa.us.

          <br /><br />

          Greetings!
          
          <br /><br />
          We thank you again for agreeing to review the applications for the
          SSGSA Application Cycle 2023-24. We have allotted 10 to 15
          applications for you to review.

          <br /><br />
          If you have reviewed the SSGSA applications in the past, you will
          mostly know the drill but there are a few updates that you must take
          note of. We held an orientation session for the same on Feb 18, 2023
          and we are providing the link to the slides and recording from our
          orientation for your reference.

          <br /><br />

          </b>

          <br /><br />
          <b>We strongly encourage you to have a look at orientation slides and
          recording before you start reviewing.</b>

          <br /><br />
          We have minor revisions to the grading rubric with details to bring
          more consistency in grading. You can download the rubric by logging
          in to the portal. Then, there are specific columns for entering the
          grades from each section as per the rubric.

          <b>Username:</b> ${email}
          <br />
          <b>Password:</b> The password you created at the time of signup. If
          you donâ€™t remember that, you have an option to reset it when you
          click on portal

          <br /><br />
          <b>Deadline:</b> March 10, 2022

          <br /><br />
          You have been allotted <b>Set ${sets}</b>. Please let us know if
          it is different from the set in the portal or have any issues, please
          do not hesitate to contact us at : contact@ssgsa.us or chair@ssgsa.us.
          
          <br /><br />
          Please try to complete the reviews before the deadline. If for any
          reason, you are unable to review the allotted applications, <b>please
          reach out to us at least a week before the deadline</b>. It becomes
          difficult to arrange for alternate reviewers at the last moment,
          causing issues in the review quality and inordinate delays in our
          decisions.
